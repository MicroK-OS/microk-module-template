# MicroKosm Module Template
Use this repository as a base for your new MicroK module.  
This contains a build system already set up for use and a basic structure for a module.  
To make it usable:
 - Change the module name in the Makefile
 - Add compatible Vendor and Product IDs in main.cpp
 - And start writing code!
